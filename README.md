# Roman-Arabic-numeral-translator

This is the final project of my first proramming course in university.

This program can translate Arabic numerals to Roman numerals and vice versa, ranging between 0 and 100,000.

--HOW TO RUN:

On windows, you may run the program using the run.bat file directly.

Or you may run the following commands manually:

    [Directory]\RomanPROJECT> javac RomanProject.java
  
    [Directory]\RomanPROJECT> java RomanProject
